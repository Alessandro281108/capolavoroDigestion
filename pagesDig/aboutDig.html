                <h1>DUODENO</h1>
                the duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is located immediately after the stomach and receives chyme, a mixture of partially digested food and gastric juices, which is then further digested and absorbed in the rest of the small intestine.
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h1>ILEO</h1>
                the ileum is the third and final part of the small intestine. It lies between the jejunum and the cecum, and it plays a crucial role in the absorption of nutrients, water, and minerals from digested food.
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h1>GASTRIC JUICES</h1>
                These are acidic digestive fluids produced by glands in the stomach lining. They contain hydrochloric acid and enzymes, such as pepsin, which help break down food for digestion.

            <div class="item">
                <h1>PHARYNX</h1>
                It's an anatomical organ located in the back of the throat. It's a muscular tubular structure that serves as a passage for food from the mouth to the esophagus and for air from the mouth to the trachea.
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h1>RECTUM</h1>
                It is the terminal part of the gastrointestinal tract, situated after the sigmoid colon. It is responsible for the temporary storage of feces before elimination through the anus during defecation.
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h1>SALIVA</h1>
                "saliva" is the term for the watery and usually slightly acidic fluid produced and secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth. It helps in the digestion of food, moistening the mouth, and begins the process of breaking down carbohydrates.
            </div>
            <div class="item">
                <h1>PEPSIN</h1>
                Pepsin is a digestive enzyme produced in the stomach, which helps digest food proteins. It is activated by the highly acidic environment of the stomach, where it begins to break down proteins into smaller peptides, thereby facilitating subsequent digestion in the digestive tract.
